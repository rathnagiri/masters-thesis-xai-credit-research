- Suitability and appropriateness assessments should consider the customer’s profile, risk tolerance, and objectives.
- Conflicts of interest must be managed and disclosed; automated advice or decisions should not disadvantage clients unfairly.
- Records should be kept to evidence how decisions were made and which inputs were considered material.
